Legacy iOS client for OpenVK instances.

Supports iOS 6.0, supports iPhones and iPads (really messy, will be fixed)

There’s a lot of bugs making this app annoying sometimes. Updates will be released infrequently. But me with my friend TimurG will commit once in sometimes, also if you’re an experienced developer in this legacy mess, we would appreaciate any pull requests, and we will review them.

This project is currently super unstable and super dooper raw for now. Will be maintained by two idiots for now since we’re the only ones that have time and passion for this. I hope we'll gain some experience in coprolite developing. Currently learning how to code on Objective-C.

This project was created by Veselcraft, and mostly coded by Miles Prower. Now it’s our time to take care of this…
